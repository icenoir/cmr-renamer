watcher.py = script to monitor folder for new files, scan the folder once on startup and then keep listening for new files
main.py = actual rename function 

suggested to use a .bat file to load the watcher on PC startup and then leave it running

to debug the position switch the "False" to "True" flag on "show_rects".
